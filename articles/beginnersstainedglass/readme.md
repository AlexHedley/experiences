### Who is this course for?

This one day class is for students who have no previous knowledge or experience working with stained glass, as all practical skills required will be taught as part of this course.

### What does the course cover?

Working with one of our templates you will choose your glass, learn how to cut the glass to size and shape.  Then how to lead your panel and solder it.

### What is included in the fee?

Your fee includes tuition by an experienced stained glass designer, the use of tools and equipment and materials.  Each student will take home a panel that they have created.

There is a maximum of 6 students per class to ensure individual attention.
