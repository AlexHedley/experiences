Create a colourful glass pumpkin for Halloween!

These experiences offer you the opportunity to personalise your pumpkin by applying coloured glass at over 1100 degrees centigrade. Working closely with our Hot Glass Studio Team you will make your own pumpkin, choosing the colour you desire and then watch our glass artists blow down the ‘iron’ to make it come to life! They will finish your artwork by using a mould to create the pumpkin shape and add a colourful stem in the effect of your choice.

Glass Pumpkins will be ready for collection 1 week after workshop. If you can not collect your pumpkin in person we offer postage & packing for £10 per pumpkin, maximum postage £20. Please note there will be no glass blowing demonstrations on these dates.
