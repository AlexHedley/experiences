This unique experience offers the opportunity to work with molten glass at over 1100 degrees centigrade! During this workshop, you will create a beautiful glass bauble to hang on your Christmas tree or to give as the perfect handmade gift. Using a variety of coloured glass you can personalise your design before our glass artists blow down the ‘iron’ to make your bauble come to life!
